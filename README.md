# RFC Tracking

Repo for issues to track progress of accepted [Ember RFCs](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs)

For each merged RFC a tracking issue is opened. It is assigned to the champion(s) of the RFC. Also available to view in a [project](https://github.com/orgs/emberjs/projects/3). 

Each RFC needs to be planned by each team. For an example of a planned RFC, see https://github.com/emberjs/rfc-tracking/issues/3

Each team may wish to amend the template for their second (listing expected areas to consider, for example).
